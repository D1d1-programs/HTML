                "Kings and queens stand with might.

Pawns advance in silent rows,

In this game, strategy grows.

 

Bishops glide, knights leap in turns,

Each move, a lesson one learns.

Rooks stand tall, guarding the flanks,

On this board, ranks upon ranks.

 

In checkmate’s grasp, the game ends,

Victory and defeat, on moves depends.

In chess’s battle, minds sharpen like swords,

In every move, wisdom accords."
