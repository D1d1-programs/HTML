            <h2>ANIME(Japanese animation)</h2>
            <p>
                Anime is a distinctive style of animation originating from Japan, known for its colorful graphics, dynamic characters, and diverse genres.
                 While the word "anime" is used in Japan to refer to animation of any kind, outside of Japan, it specifically refers to Japanese animation.
                  Anime production often emphasizes detailed settings and camera effects, and it has become a global phenomenon, with a wide range of genres and a dedicated international fanbase.
